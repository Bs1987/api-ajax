- [x] Make a div
- [x] ul
- [] Make request for list with names (from API)  
  - [x]  import axios (done in setup with script in HTML)
  - [x] Make async function
  - [x] axios.get(url)
  - [x] add await to make it wait
- [] Display list with names
    - Loop
    - document.createElement
    - add innerText (name)
    - appendChild

2. As a teacher I want to be able to add a student, so my list can stay up to date.

3. As a teacher I want to be able to remove a student, so I can deal with abusive students.
